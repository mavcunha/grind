SUBCOMMAND_DESC="Library for dry-run mode"
SUBCOMMAND_HELP=$(cat <<EOH

Usage:

This library should be included when we
want override the main execution function
for a NOOP function.

Functions:

__run       This function actually override the
            same function on '_core' library.

# aware users of dry-run mode
[[ -z ${*} ]] || in_yellow "dry-run mode enabled\n"

function __run() {
  local cmd="${1}"
  log "__run (dry-run): ${cmd}"
}

# this is a hack, as part of __conditional_run, __yellow_box will be called
# with 'RUN' and we just override __run to a noop. 
# But the call to __yellow_box still happens which leads 
# to output like [RUN][NOOP]
# So what we do is to override __yellow_box for a __magenta_box 'NOOP'
# any calls to __yellow_box at this mode will lead to a NOOP message.
# the assumption here is that __yellow_box is only called for 'RUN'
# messages and nothing else otherwise will confuse the user.
function __yellow_box() { 
  __magenta_box 'NOOP' 
}
