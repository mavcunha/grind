SUBCOMMAND_DESC="Library for forced execution mode"
SUBCOMMAND_HELP=$(cat <<EOH

Usage:

This library should be included when we
want to force executions even when run check
would prevent execution

Functions:

__conditional_run CMD       Will not actually be conditional, it will
                            call __run ignoring the result of a run check
